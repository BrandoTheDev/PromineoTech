1. I want to know how many employees with each title were born after 1965-01-01.

mysql> SELECT e.birth_date as 'Birthday', t.title as 'Title', count(*) as 'Total'
    -> FROM employees e
    -> INNER JOIN titles t
    -> ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no
    -> GROUP BY birth_date
    -> HAVING e.birth_date > '1965-01-01'
    -> LIMIT 20;

2. I want to know the average salary per title.

mysql> SELECT DISTINCT(t.title), avg(s.salary) as 'Average Salary' FROM titles t
    -> INNER JOIN salaries s
    -> ON s.emp_no = t.emp_no
    -> GROUP BY t.title
    -> LIMIT 20;

3. How much money was spent on salary for the marketing department between the years 1990 and 1992?

mysql> SELECT cde.dept_no as 'Marketing Dept', SUM(s.salary) as 'Total Salary'
    -> FROM current_dept_emp cde
    -> INNER JOIN salaries s ON cde.emp_no = s.emp_no
    -> INNER JOIN departments d ON d.dept_no = cde.dept_no
    -> WHERE cde.dept_no = 'd001' AND s.from_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1992-01-01';
